##Baseball Sparklines

Baseball season results visualized as [sparklines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline). This is a d3-based copy of the charts shown on page 174 of [The Visual Display of Quantative Information by Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) (2nd ed.). Based on a post in [a discussion thread on edwardtufte.com](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001lh), the same charts appear in [Beautiful Evidence]() on [page 6](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/images/0001nc-1974.gif).

All [post-deadball era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead-ball_era) (1919 – 2015) seasons are available. [Check it out](http://swingley.github.io/baseball-sparklines/). 

Win-loss data was scraped from [baseball-reference](http://www.baseball-reference.com/).
