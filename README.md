##Baseball Sparklines

Baseball season results visualized as [sparklines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline). This is a d3-based copy of the charts shown on page 174 of [The Visual Display of Quantative Information by Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) (2nd ed.). Based on a post in [a discussion thread on edwardtufte.com](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001lh), the same charts appear in [Beautiful Evidence]() on [page 6](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/images/0001nc-1974.gif).

All [post-deadball era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead-ball_era) (1919 – 2015) seasons are available. Enough babbling, [check it out](http://swingley.github.io/baseball-sparklines/)! Use the "Change Year" button in the upper-right to select a year (or fiddle with the query string such as [?year=2001](http://swingley.github.io/baseball-sparklines/?year=2001)). 

On larger screens, tap a chart to make it bigger. Here's a gif showing that effect in action: ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/0H421s1d2U061E2Q1s36/Screen%20Recording%202016-02-04%20at%2002.02%20PM.gif?v=4e1098c7)
